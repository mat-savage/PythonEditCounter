# Python Edit Counter

## Version

This is version 0.2. It seems to work, but needs some more testing, and to be a bit more robust in the error handling, whatnot.

## Summary

This is an arcpy add-in extension for ESRI ArcMap that automatically updates unique value renderer symbology labels with counts and percentages of total as you edit.
